## General Information

The main reason why I created this web application was that I wanted to know about a margin of our national diesel supplier. Therefore I use API request to get information about actual USD/PL' exchange rate. 
Moreover I can calculate my monthly journeys, when I use a diesel car.

This application was created using Flask and SQLlite database.
